What are the preferences for the console? Especially check the settings "Fixed width console" plus "Limit console output". Maybe your console simply can't hold that many characters in one line.

[EDIT] Now Eclipse eventually has to cut the data in the console since it doesn't have infinite amounts of memory. If the console is still cut off, you can use this trick: Open the "Run Configurations" dialog (Found in the drop down menu for the green "run" button).

The tab "Common" tab has options in the "Standard Input and Output" group at the bottom to save a copy of all output in a file. You can then use your OSs tools to examine this file.

Also note that very long lines can make Eclipse slow (i.e. it can hang for a couple of seconds). This is due to a bug in the regexp matching patterns for Exception stack traces. If that happens, limit the line length to 1000 characters or less.

This is especially a problem with Spring which sometimes creates exceptions that have 50'000 characters in the message.

If you have a similar problem with the CDT Global Build Console, see here: Eclipse CDT Build Console output not displaying entire compiler output
